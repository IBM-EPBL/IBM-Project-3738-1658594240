<h3>PROBLEM</h3> 
<p>Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming po
ols are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have them in their house backy
ard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn c
auses a drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher rate of mortality without causing injury to childr
en. Children under six of their age are found to be suffering the highest drowning mortality rates worldwide. Such ki
nds of deaths account for the third cause of unplanned death globally, with about 1.2 million cases yearly.</p>

<h3>SOLUTION</h3> 
<p>To overcome this conflict, a meticulous system is to be implemented along the swimming pools to save hum
an life. 
By studying body movement patterns and connecting cameras to artificial intelligence (AI) systems we can devi
se an underwater pool safety system that reduces the risk of drowning. Usually, such systems can be developed by i
nstalling more than 16 cameras underwater and ceiling and analyzing the video feeds to detect any anomalies. but A
S a POC we make use of one camera that streams the video underwater and analyses the position of swimmers to ass
ess the probability of drowning, if it is higher then an alert will be generated to attract lifeguards' attention.</p>
